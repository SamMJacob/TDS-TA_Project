And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it\u2019s a public data source. But that\u2019s the first way\u2014you download the data. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. The third way is you have to scrape it . It\u2019s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It\u2019s available on a PDF file. It\u2019s available in a Word document. It\u2019s available on an Excel file. It\u2019s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library.

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other.

Find similar documents to a query. Classification . Classify text into categories. Clustering . Group similar items into clusters. Anomaly Detection . Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. Feature Local Models API Privacy High Dependent on provider Cost High setup, low after that Pay-as-you-go Scale Limited by local resources Easily scales with demand Quality Varies by model Typically high The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: Rank . Higher ranked models have higher quality. Memory Usage . Lower is better (for similar ranks).

Gemini transcription The Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways: They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully . They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: Transcribe into other languages . Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. Summarize audio transcripts .

By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. Install and run TypeSense Install TypeSense . mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108 :8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key = secret-key \\ --enable-cors Copy to clipboard Error Copied docker run : spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 -p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port. -v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence. --data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume. --api-key=secret-key secures your API. --enable-cors allows browser-based requests.

This course exposes you to real-life tools Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models. But one critical subject that\u2019s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them? These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school: You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you\u2019ll have to scrape them yourself. You learn how to train models. But soon, you\u2019ll just pick something from HuggingFace. You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a sed + grep script in minutes. \u201cWe lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You\u2019ll have to decode the regexes yourself.\u201d In this course, we\u2019ve curated the most important tools people use in data science. Learn them well. You\u2019ll be a lot more productive than your peers. This course is quite hard Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback: 2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it\u2019s hard and covers more.

Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback: Course experience and farewell post Programming skills are a pre-requisite You need a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts. But isn\u2019t this a data science course? Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don\u2019t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process. In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, some of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself. This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you do need programming to learn many of them. If you passed, don't enroll again The course is public, so you can always audit it. Also, registering again for the course does not improve marks much . We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants."}

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable."}

{"id": "bd7f81fc-eb3a-4c27-93e0-0cca2caadf4a", "type": "discourse", "text": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently. --- Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment."}
{"id": "79fb46ec-13fe-450f-bcc1-07ff312edb5f", "type": "discourse", "text": "The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) \u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing. \u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt \u2022 Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. \u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt \u2022 If you don\u2019t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. \u2022 If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts \u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall."}

Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards --- For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head . --- Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students."}

All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv."}

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure. --- Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs?? --- ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc. Kind regards --- The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines.

Kind regards --- Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test? --- Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens. Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique.

ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs.

So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE.

The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites , leading many students\u2014including those from non-technical backgrounds \u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for working professionals and students without prior experience."}

We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding.

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered \u201cimpossible\u201d by students: What\u2019s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores."}

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response. --- Please look into it sir. --- Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post.

Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed . And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you\u2019re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate."}
{"id": "e1857ee1-43ad-4293-b65b-21bfdec7ed50", "type": "discourse", "text": "If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you\u2019ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day."}

And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity."}

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response."}

However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations."}

And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16.

In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh.

The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.

We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V. Upadhyay --- 23f2004912: There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn\u2019t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I\u2019m seeing in groups that there\u2019s an \u201cextra benefit\u201d being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance."}
