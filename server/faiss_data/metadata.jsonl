This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nUse Cases:\nLLM training and fine-tuning\n: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\nKnowledge base creation\n: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\nContent repurposing\n: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\nData extraction\n: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\nAccessibility\n: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\nCitation and reference management\n: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\nDocumentation conversion\n: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\nPyMuPDF4LLM\nPyMuPDF4LLM\n is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It\u2019s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses \nMuPDF\n as its PDF parsing engine. \nPyMuPDF\n is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\nPYTHONUTF8\n=\n1\n uv run \n--with\n pymupdf4llm python \n-c\n \n'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPYTHONUTF8=1\n: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\nuv run --with pymupdf4llm\n: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\npython -c '...'\n: Executes Python code directly from the command line\nimport pymupdf4llm\n: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\nh = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")\n: Creates a file to write the markdown output\nh.write(pymupdf4llm.to", "source": "scraped_page", "url": "https://tds.s-anand.net#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown", "title": "https_tds.s-anand.net__convert-pdfs-to-markdown", "date": null}

Find similar documents to a query.\nClassification\n. Classify text into categories.\nClustering\n. Group similar items into clusters.\nAnomaly Detection\n.

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\nWhat Makes an Agent?\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\nLLM Brain\n: Makes decisions about what to do next\nTools\n: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\nMemory\n: Retains context across multiple steps\nAgents operate through a loop:\nObserve the environment\nThink about what to do\nTake action using tools\nObserve results\nRepeat until task completion\nCommand-Line Agent Example\nWe\u2019ve created a minimal command-line agent called \nllm-cmd-agent.py\n that:\nTakes a task description from the command line\nGenerates code to accomplish the task\nAutomatically extracts and executes the code\nPasses the results back to the LLM\nProvides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \n\"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\n\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \n\"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nThe agent will:\nGenerate a shell script to list files with their sizes\nExecute the script in a subprocess\nCapture the output (stdout and stderr)\nPass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\nPresent a final answer to the user\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\nInitial prompt to generate a shell script\nCode extraction from the LLM response\nCode execution in a subprocess\nResult interpretation by the LLM\nError handling and retry logic if needed\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\nPlanning (generating code)\nExecution (running the code)\nReflection (interpreting results)\nAdaptation (fixing errors if needed)\nAgent Architectures\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\nReAct\n (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\nReflexion\n: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\nMRKL\n (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\nPlan-and-Execute\n: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\nReal-World Applications\nLL", "source": "scraped_page", "url": "https://tds.s-anand.net#/llm-agents", "title": "https_tds.s-anand.net__llm-agents", "date": null}

{"text": "Tools in Data Science - May 2025\nTools in Data Science\n is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\n\n\nThis course exposes you to real-life tools\n\n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that\u2019s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\nYou learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you\u2019ll have to scrape them yourself.\nYou learn how to train models. But soon, you\u2019ll just pick something from HuggingFace.\nYou learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a \nsed\n + \ngrep\n script in minutes.\n \u201cWe lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You\u2019ll have to decode the regexes yourself.\u201d\nIn this course, we\u2019ve curated the most important tools people use in data science.\nLearn them well. You\u2019ll be a \nlot\n more productive\n than your peers.\n\n\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\n\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\n2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed\nIt \nused\n to be an easy course until 2024.\n\n#\n\n\n#\n\n\n#\nNow it\u2019s hard and covers more.

It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\n\n\nBut it's probably worth it.\n\n\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\nCourse experience and farewell post\n\n\n\n\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\n\n\nYou need a \ngood\n understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\nBut isn\u2019t this a data science course?\n Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don\u2019t just analyze data or train models.

Some popular ones are:\nchroma 19,637 \u2b50 May 2025\nqdrant 23,341 \u2b50 May 2025\nlancedb 6,327 \u2b50 May 2025\nfaiss 34,684 \u2b50 May 2025\nmilvus 34,476 \u2b50 May 2025\nweaviate 13,222 \u2b50 May 2025\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:\nDuckDB\n: Supports vector search with \nvss\n.\nSQLite\n: Supports vector search with \nsqlite-vec\n.\nPostgreSQL\n: Supports vector search with \npgvector\n.\nTake a look at this \nVector DB Comparison\n.\nWatch this Vector Database Tutorial (3 min):\nChromaDB\nHere\u2019s a minimal example using Chroma:\n# /// script\n\n\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n\n\n# dependencies = [\n\n\n#   \"chromadb\",\n\n\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n\n\n# ]\n\n\n# ///\n\n\n\nimport\n chromadb\n\nfrom\n chromadb\n.\nutils \nimport\n embedding_functions\n\nfrom\n sentence_transformers \nimport\n SentenceTransformer\n\n\nasync\n \ndef\n \nsetup_vector_db\n(\n)\n:\n\n    \n\"\"\"Initialize Chroma DB with an embedding function.\"\"\"\n\n    sentence_transformer_ef \n=\n embedding_functions\n.\nSentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction\n(\n\n        model_name\n=\n\"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\"\n\n    \n)\n\n    client \n=\n chromadb\n.\nPersistentClient\n(\npath\n=\n\"./vector_db\"\n)\n\n    collection \n=\n client\n.\ncreate_collection\n(\n\n        name\n=\n\"documents\"\n,\n\n        embedding_function\n=\nsentence_transformer_ef\n    \n)\n\n    \nreturn\n collection\n\n\nasync\n \ndef\n \nsearch_similar\n(\ncollection\n,\n query\n:\n \nstr\n,\n n_results\n:\n \nint\n \n=\n \n3\n)\n \n-\n>\n \n", "source": "scraped_page", "url": "https://tds.s-anand.net#/vector-databases", "title": "https_tds.s-anand.net__vector-databases", "date": null}

{"text": "Serverless hosting: Vercel\n\n\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They\u2019re perfect for small web tools that \ndon\u2019t need to run all the time\n. Here are some common real-life uses:\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they\u2019re done, these copies disappear. It\u2019s cheaper than running a full-time server because you\u2019re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\nYou can\u2019t \npip install\n packages - you have to use \nrequirements.txt\nYou can\u2019t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\nYou can\u2019t run commands (e.g. \nsubprocess.run()\n)\nVercel\n is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions.

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n\n---\n\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation\n \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability\n \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n\n\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Best for \nreproducibility\n and \ncollaboration\n since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\n\n\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndon\u2019t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\n\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n\n\u2022 Using \ngreater", "source": "discourse", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922", "title": "Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python", "date": "2025-01-31T06:26:47.382Z"}
{"text": " than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n\nBest Practices Summary\n\n\n\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n\n\nUse a \nrequirements.txt\n file for reproducibility.\n\n\nPin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n\n\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nFor some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\n\n\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\n\n\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing to your second question,\n\n\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\n\n\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\n\n\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, \npip3 freeze > requirements.txt \n. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n\n---\n\nThank you sir for clarifying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n carlton:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Using \ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of greater than/less than constraint.

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\n\n---\n\nHi Hari,\n\n\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\n\nKind regards", "source": "discourse", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/llm-what-rocket-science-going-on-here/166303", "title": "LLM what rocket science going on here", "date": "2025-02-05T05:04:10.130Z"}

The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.\n\n---\n\nKindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir.

This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\n\n\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\n\n\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\n\n\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\n\n\nKind regards\n\nTDS Team\n\n---\n\n-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.\n\n\n@carlton\n \n@s.anand\n Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.\n\nPlease sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks", "source": "discourse", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866", "title": "--Request for postponing the Project -1 deadline-- Official Response: Extended :)", "date": "2025-02-12T14:07:52.702Z"}

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\n\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\n\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n\n\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n\n\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\n\n\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n\n\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\n\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n\n\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\n\n\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\n\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\n\nKind regards", "source": "discourse", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/sudo-permission-needed-to-create-data-folder-in-root/167072", "title": "Sudo permission needed to create data folder in root?", "date": "2025-02-14T03:57:16.661Z"}

{"text": "QUESTION 9\n\n\nI was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\n\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes.

Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\n\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n\n---\n\ni downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this\n\n\nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online\n, it worked", "source": "discourse", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057", "title": "QUESTION 9 of TDS WEEK 5 GA", "date": "2025-02-22T04:50:25.756Z"}

Or is the ROE more complex structured ?\n\nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\n\n---\n\nSir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??\n\n---\n\nROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\n\n\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\n\n\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you\u2026 past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the \u201chooomann\u201d \n\n\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\n\n\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset.

Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\n\n\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\n\n\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\n\n\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\n\n\nThanks for bearing with us.

However, the reality is that the \ncourse content, assignments, and projects\n have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n\n \nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\n\nThe \ndifficulty of the projects\n has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to \nrely heavily on peer support\n just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n\n \nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\n\n\nMany students joined \nTDS\n based on past \nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for \nworking professionals\n and students without prior experience.\n\n\n \nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\n\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending \n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\n to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves \nstruggling to meet expectations\n for the \nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\n\nThank you for your time", "source": "discourse", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476", "title": "Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness", "date": "2025-02-25T17:21:11.726Z"}

{"text": " ready for this course.\n Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - \nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\n\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\n\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what you\u2019ve learnt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a \nnice blog\n where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners.

{"text": " that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - \nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\n The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n\n@22f2001640\n Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy.

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\n\n\nI understand that the grading can\u2019t be changed.

{"text": " of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16.

However, I won\u2019t be able to present the project in a public session as my \nAzure API URL would be exposed\n, and since it incurs \ncosts per usage\n, I need to keep it secure.\n\n\nI\u2019d prefer a \nprivate meet\n to demonstrate the project.

I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\n\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\n\n\nThank you and Regards\n\nAkshit\n\n---\n\nYes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.\n\nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.\n\nIs this information available to everyone \n@carlton\n sir?\n\n---\n\nHello \n@carlton\n \n@Jivraj\n \n@Saransh_Saini\n \n@s.anand\n sir,\n\nI hope you are doing well.\n\n\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7.
