Hi Guddu,


Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.

---

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.


Try adding CORS to your code it might work.


Kind regards

Jivraj

 Kindly help me out.

Hi Mishkat,


Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.


eg


if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")



Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.


Thanks and kind regards

sir did you check yet what is the problem in this one?

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from typing import List, Optional
import csv

app = FastAPI()

# Enable CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers
)

# Load student data from the specified CSV file
students = []
with open('/Users/mish/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv', mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        students.append({
            "studentId": int(row["studentId"]),
            "class": row["class"]
        })

@app.get("/api")
async def get_students(class_: Optional[List[str]] = Query(None)):
    print(f"Requested classes: {class_}")  # Debugging line
    if class_:
        filtered_students = [student for student in students if student["class"] in class_]
        print(f"Filtered students: {filtered_students}")  # Debugging line
        return {"students": filtered_students}
    return {"students": students}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

---

Hi Mishkat,


This error is because you are filtering on 
class_
 instead of 
class


So if you send a request on 
http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S
 you will see response for that 
1S
 class only.


kind regards

---

thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted

---

Hi Guddu,


Inside 
index.html
 file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.


This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.


kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.


Docker Desktop Error
558×377 27 KB


I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).


wsl --version


WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011



Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.

So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

---

Hi Telvin,


Try opening 
localhost:8080
 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.


I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.


kind regards


kind regards

@Nelson
 I would recommend 
Podman
 or 
Docker CE
 rather than 
Docker Desktop
.


Docker Desktop is 
not free for organizations over 250 people
 and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@Jivraj
 I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.

---

@22f2001640
 in that case




a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or


a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080




Please try one of these:




Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network


GitHub codespaces, as 
@Jivraj
 suggested




You 
could
 try an ngrok alternative like 
localtunnel
 but I don’t think that’ll work.
