Hi 
@carlton
,

My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.


Regards,

Ajit

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by.


Kind regards

@carlton

---

We are releasing them today. You will get an email with lots of goodies in it

It is more frightening now…

---

If we failed in project1 then we will be awarded free marks in Project2 Please conform that 
@carlton
 at least give us some awards for our hard work (Summer special offer), what do you say?

---

I think something heavy is coming… But it’s 9:30, and nothing’s here yet. Taking their time, I see!

---

We have marks but we are sending you a package of items as well, for your benefit.

---

We have been waiting for you for a month… and our patience is wearing thin

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.

i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25


Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

---

Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website link.

Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding 
Project 1
 results. Could you please confirm if there’s an issue?

my mail id: 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

---

No issue with your submission, you will get a good score.


Kind regards

---

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.


Kind regards
