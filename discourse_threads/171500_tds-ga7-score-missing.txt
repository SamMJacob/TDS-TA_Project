 how to peer review for GA7 where is the link??

Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.

(roughly 3 days before end term).


Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

Hi 
@carlton
 sir,

I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.


Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?
