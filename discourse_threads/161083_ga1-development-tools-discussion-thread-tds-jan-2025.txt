For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "

Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as

2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt

eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt

That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0.

@Jivraj
 let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

Hi anant,


Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.


In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

---

Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

@21f2000370
 Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Which HTML content we want to take?

Hi Suhani,


npm does not require docker.


Kind regards

Hi Hisham,


Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Hi manmeet,


I don’t know about solution to this.

Some network setting might be causing problem.


Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.


I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

Hi mishkat,
