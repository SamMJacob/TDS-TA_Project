Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.


GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.


Kind regards

Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.


Thanks

Hi 
@22f2000559


I can confirm that our server did record your marks as 7, we will make a correction in the dashboard. Thanks for letting us know. My sincere apologies for the error.


If the marks on the dashboard are not changed within the next 7 days, please let us know. I will follow it up on my end and try to get the correction pushed as soon as possible.


Kind regards
