“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”

So I did. 




 
Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments
 


Yes, I got 
great marks
 in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.

But let’s be real…


It was 
my Labrador
 who did the actual work 


While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:




Solving 
deployment issues
 faster than my dev server boots


Writing 
function calling code
 like a true GPT whisperer


Fixing 
LLM bugs
 that I didn’t even understand




Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.

He growled at broken APIs.

I took the credit. 




 Message from the Dog Developer:




“Thank you all for an awesome semester!

I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.

But I am 
personally offended
 by one thing…”






“How dare you give 
bonus marks on Week 7
?

I skipped it — just like many — because we were told 
only best 4 of 7 would count
.

I demand justice. And a belly rub.”

– 
, Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist






 Moral of the story:


Let your pets help with your coursework.

You get the grade. They get the rage.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t hurt him any further.

I know this is obviously a joke but, is there a rule book by any chance ?

I think you feed your dog desi ghee instead of pedigree
